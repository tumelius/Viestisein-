# The Great Wall of Messages (GWM)
Goal of this project is to create a web-based application to display messages on a screen.
Users can send messages throug web-form
Messages are moderated by moderator. Moderator can publish, delete of hide messages.

The next step would be to add SMS-support. So that messages could be sent not only by web-browser but also by SMS.

Any ideas how to accomplish that are taken into account.
